I have been working with wood since I was a kid, but recently I dove head first into fine woodworking and furnituremaking. I particularly enjoy building shaker-style and shaker-influlenced furniture. The design philosophy of "form follows function" resonates with me.

I discovered Fine Woodworking Magazine at my local library and started ingesting the information one issue at a time. I discovered that by reading so much about how to build fine furniture, that I skipped right over the not-so-fine furniture that many people start with. By the time I got my first dovetail saw and cut my first set of [far from perfect] dovetails, I was not intimated because I had read so much on techniques. I got by with a simple set of tools in the second bedroom of our small apartment for a year or two. By the time I had an opportunity to use a fully equipt shop, I knew how to use every machine to do exactly what I wanted.
