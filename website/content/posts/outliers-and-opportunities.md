I recently listened to Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, a book about successful people and what made them successful. The resonating theme througout the book (spoiler alert) is that behind each successful person is a series small, often unique, opportunities that prepared the person to succeed. Specifically, the opportunity to practice something more than their peers.

While some would argue that hard work alone is enough to succeed, Gladwell shows again and again that in order to put in enough hard work to make a difference (10,000 hours to be specific) one needs to be surrounded by the right people/infrastructure, at the right time, and above all take advantage of every opportunity.

Since finishing the book, I have been reflecting on the turning points in my life and whether they were a result of luck, hard work, or a little bit of both. The first such turning point that comes to mind was a two-week high school study abroad trip to Norway. We attended Folkehogskolen 69 Grader Nord, a Norwegian "folk" school just outside of Troms√∏ that cateres to students between high school and college and specializes in dogsledding. 

Such an offering was just as uncommon at my school as any other school in the country. In fact, the trip was only offered at my school for two years (I participated the second year). Only juniors were considered for the trip, but since I, a sophmore, was friends with the teachers, they were able to talk the administration into letting me go, despite much pushback.

So, there was this oportunity that I could have let go because it was too difficult, but instead I grabbed on and it was the most educational experience in my secondary school years. I wrote my college essays on how it taught me how to learn and teach by doing and talked people's ears off about it for years to come.
