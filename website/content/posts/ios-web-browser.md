So much of our web browsing happens on our mobile devices and yet the most useful button hidden in all iOS web browsers. When you launch Safari, Chrome, or Firefox from your iPhone or iPad, you probably want to open a new "tab" and search for something, right? For some reason Apple and other developers have hidden the "new tab" button in the "tabs" icon. You might think that I'm lazy for not wanting to press two buttons, but there a few problems here.

First, the "tabs" window is often slow to load depending on how many websites you have open. Second, there is a nice annimation as all of the web pages zoom out to the multi-page view. Annimations take time and all I want to do is open a new webpage, not see what I already have open. There has to be a better way.

I know that screen realestate is limited on mobile browsers, especially for phones, although as screen sizes increase, it is less of a problem. In Safari, for example, there is nothing on the top bar except for the address box. This could be a perfect place to add a + icon to open a new page. How simple would that be. Best of all, it would only chop a few characters off of the URL that you don't need to see anyways.

Indeed, Apple did include a "+" button in the original iOS, but the release of iOS 4 banished the new tab button from the main view.

This is less of a complaint and more of a plea. Someone - please make a mobile web browser that has a + icon in the main view. I can't fathom how this has escaped Sir. Ive's team for 10 years.

iOS 3 (iPhone 3G) was the last version of iOS to have a prominate shortcut for "new page" in Safari.
