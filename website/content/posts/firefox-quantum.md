## Overview

I have been using Google Chrome as my primary web browser (and recommending it to collegues) for years. Using Google Chrome was a decision based mostly on performance and compatibility, but also on design. Firefox's newest release v.57.0, i.e. Firefox Quantum, has changed things for me. Mozilla has redesigned the UI which rivals Chrome in terms of simplicity and the preformance exceeds that of Google Chrome.

## Design

Considering only the UI, Firefox Quantum is a **huge** improvement over the older versions (Fig. 1; far left and right respectively). It even rivals Chrome's already minimal design (Fig. 1; middle). Quantum's new tab goes right to the top of the window, utilizing every bit of available real estate without dipping down into content land. I know that we're talking about a few pixels here, but I take my screen real estate seriously. It wasn't going to take much to improve Firefox's UI, but Mozilla did nothing short of an excellent job.

## Performance

I have done a few page load comparisons between Firefox and Chrome. In my limited (and unscientific) testing, some pages load faster in Firefox and some load faster in Chrome. Regardless, I have not been blown away by the speed improvements, but haven't noticed any lagging either.

## Printing & Google Docs

The only gripe I have with Firefox Quantum is the lack of printing compatibility with Google Docs (which I use often). When you try printing a Google Doc from Quantum, you get a Google Cloud Print dialog with options to "Print from my computer" or "Save to Google Drive". When you select "Print from my computer" it downloads the file as a PDF for you to "print from your computer". I originally took this to mean "print using system dialogue", which is far from the case.

I suppose that this is probably more of a "Google pushing Google Cloud Print" thing and less of a "Firefox not supporting Google Docs" thing. I have since enabled Google Cloud Printing on my office printer, but it is still a huge inconvienience when using printers that do not support Google Cloud Printing.

Chrome also excells at PDF viewing. In Firefox, you need the Adobe plugin to view PDFs in-browser, which Chrome does natively. These basic functions are almost enough to drive me back to Google Chrome, but I'll stick it out a little longer and try to find a reasonable workaround.


## Conclusion

I never thought that I'd stray from Chrome, but Firefox's sleek new UI combined with its powerful engine makes it my new favorite web browser.
