Don't get me wrong. I love open source software. Most of the servers that I run at work are CentOS (some RHEL and Fedora). These operating systems are phenomenal and the communty exceptional. We have a support agreement with RHEL, so I have access to their documentation, but 99% of the time Stack Exchange has the same information/solution. That is true for much of the open source software that I have used - great communities able and willing to help you in any way possible.

However, there are some instances where open source really isn't the best way to go. When a GUI is concerned, it is almost always worth giving strong consideration to paid software.
