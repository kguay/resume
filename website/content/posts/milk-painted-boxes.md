I'm not good at making birthday and holiday gifts for family. Woodworking under pressure is never fun, but if I get started early enough, it's nice to work on small projects that can go from rough wood to a finished product in a week or two. Aside from some picture frames, this was my first foray into miters. Long edge miters (4 inches in this case) are quite a different beast than < 1 inch picture frame miters.
