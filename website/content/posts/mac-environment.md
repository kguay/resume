## Overview

Everyone has a different workflow and favorite apps. If my hard drive crashed* and I was rebuilding my computer there would be certain apps that I would reinstall right away. These apps are essential to my workflow for different reasons, but they are all high-quality cutting edge apps that make work easier.

## Communication and Utility

### Spark

### Slack

### Things3

### 1Password

## Development

### iTerm2
iTerm2 offers a few features that the MacOS's built-in terminal doesn't. These include a split window view, encrypted password manager, and a ton of customizations. 

### TextMate2
TextMate2 is my favorite text editor. I know that this is a very personal thing and everyone has a strong opinion (are there any vi fans still reading?). TextMate works well for me because it has a great balance of features and ability to customize. It also works really well with a shell, either local or remote. Since I don't use an IDE, by dev environment consists of an iTerm2 window and a TextMate window (or a few). TextMate allows me to open files from any server on my local machine using a lightweight ruby or shell script called rmate (remote mate).
