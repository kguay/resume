## Overview

Amazon has become the go-to place to buy everything, but has that come at a cost to the environment? 

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that UPS wasn't delivering any packages to your area before Amazon. That is, UPS dedicated a truck to your town *because* everyone started ordering from Amazon.

## Scenario
I am working under the following assumptions/scenario:
* UPS delivers to A-Town using their ubiquitous P70 box truck
* P70's average 10.2 MPG and run on diesel
* A-Town residence have cars with an average of 25MPG and run on diesel
* Your town has 50 people that use Amazon for purchase that they would have normally gone to Walmart for
* About a quarter of the time a customer would have to visit two stores to find what they were looking for
* There is a Walmart in the town shopping center, which is an average of 10 miles from every home
* For the sake of simplicity, we are going to assume that the same amount of carbon is used to transport goods to an Amazon distribution center as a Walmart store

## Pre-Amazon
Before everyone in A-Town started using Amazon, they were shopping primarily at Walmart. 

- 10 miles รท 25MPG = 0.4 gallons
- 0.4 gallons x 19.6 pounds of CO2 per gallon = 7.84 pounds of CO2

## Amazon

- 10 miles รท 25MPG = 0.4 gallons
- 0.4 gallons x 19.6 pounds of CO2 per gallon = 7.84 pounds of CO2
